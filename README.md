FMC-NVME-M.2-SSD-Card is an adapter that allows M.2 NVMe PCIe SSDs to be connected to FPGA and MPSoC based development boards. The adapter uses the FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) form factor for connection with FPGA and MPSoC development boards via the FMC connector. It has 2x M-key M.2 sockets and can carry M.2 PCIe SSDs. Each M.2 socket has its own independent connection to the FPGA for maximum throughput and can support a 4-lane PCIe connection up to Gen3.
